# 221miniproject2

A little project that I, along with a partner, worked on for my CPEN 221 class. 

It is a game based on graphs where a spaceship, which starts on Earth, searches in the universe for Planet Kamino. On the way back from Kamino to Earth, the spaceship must collect maximum spice as possible without running out of fuel (variation of TSP).
